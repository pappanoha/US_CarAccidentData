# US_CarAccidentData
Data collected from: https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents
first project in data mining/analytics. focused on US car accident data collected over the course of four years. Initially I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the amount of accidents and the type of weather that was reported. Though I needed additional weather datasets for those four years to properly analyze that. I ended up looking at the severity of the accidents that occurred in different types of weather instead.
